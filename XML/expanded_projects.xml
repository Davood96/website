            This project provided my first opportunity at professional software development
            in a team, in particular agile development. My role on this project was mainly as 
            design lead, meaning I was responsible for the architecture of the system and various algorithms
            used. Some notable features include: graphing functionality, minimum parenthesization and favorites

            A summer project aimed at improving my design skills. Eclipse and its git plugin were used for project organization
            and version control respectively. In addition to the architecture, the following tasks had
            to be undertaken:

            A summer project undertaken to gain experience in C++ development. This involved extensive use of pointers
            and hence operations involving pointers, in addition to expanding possible approaches to software
            design. Final design is essentially the STATE pattern, where each space on a monopoloy board is a LANDING_SPACE.
            Git and GNU Make were used for version control and project organization respectively.
